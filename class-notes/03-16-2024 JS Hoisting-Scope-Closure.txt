JS Hoisting: (BEFORE ES6)
-Moving the declaration of variables to the top


var, let, const
var -> before ES6 
let, const -> After ES6

var name = 'John';


var is hoisted.
let and const are not hoisted.


Global scope: can be used anywhere within the file but be careful about the declaration (don't use any
variables before their declaration)


Function Scope: variables created within the function can only be used in that function body. You cannot use
them outside the function body.
